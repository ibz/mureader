<p>musocial is a minimalist social network. an anti-social network, if you want to call it like that. you can use it to follow people that publish rss / atom feeds on their personal websites.</p>
<p>simple design that stays out your way, inspired by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">hacker news</a> and <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">pinboard</a></p>
